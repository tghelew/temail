#+TITLE: SoGo - Web based Groupware Server
#+author: Thierry Ghelew

* Summary
This part is about configuring [[https://www.sogo.nu/][SoGo]] which is used for Web based email, calendar, contact. Configuration is properly documented in [[https://www.sogo.nu/files/docs/SOGoInstallationGuide.html][Sogo Support pages]].
This is the only reason I had to break my wish to only use base tool from OpenBSD.
