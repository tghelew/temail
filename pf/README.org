* Summary
This part is about configuring the [[https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/][packet filter]] included by default in base. A general goal with this configuration is to block incoming traffics as much as possible and only let know users or machine to enter the system.
At the same time I want to make it as painful as possible anyone that want to force the access to my server.
** Tables
- *t_server*: this is the list of authorized server which are my mails servers. Server-to-Server communication should consist of replication, health, and synchronization protocols.
- *t_allowed*: this is the list of ip that is allowed. I use it to mainly allowed DNS request to my [[https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/][Unbound]] server which also act as an AdBlocker.
- *t_blocked*: list of ips that I want to manually for one reason or another.
- *t_bruteforce*: list of ips automatically added which are blocked for a given period of time
