#+TITLE: Certificate (Let's Encrypt & custom) Configuration
#+author: Thierry Ghelew

* Summary
This part is about setting up [[https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/][cerbot]] for [[https://letsencrypt.org][Let's Encrypt]] certificates. I wanted to have a wildcard certificate for each of my domains and therefore could not use acme-client on OpenBSD.
All certificates will be generated from the controller server and distributed to mail servers.
Note that as I still have wildcard certificates that I've purchased for my old mail servers and want to use them, I've included mechanism to manage them as well.
