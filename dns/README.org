This part setup [[https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.18.25/index.html][BIND9]] dns server which is the authoritative dns for my domains. It is hidden by default and only the slave read-only server is visible online.
The configuration is quite complex but well described in the above link. I am forced to used BIND9 instead of the included
NSD (in OpenBSD) because I need to:
- Include recursive dns queries as this dns server is also used privately.
- Include response policy which /as far as I know/ are not included in NSD.
- Use dynamic dns due to Let's encrypt requirements. I wants to have a wildcard certificate for all my domains.
