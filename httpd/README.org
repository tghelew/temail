#+TITLE: HTTPD Configuration
#+author: Thierry Ghelew

* Summary
This part is about configuring [[https://man.openbsd.org/httpd][httpd]] for my mail server and certificate validation. As the configuration is self explanatory have a look at [[https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf.5][httpd.conf]] for more details as to the meaning of those file. Proxy and load balancing is performed thanks to [[https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.conf][Relayd]] which either forward request either internally to httpd or externally to my mail server (for rspamd).
