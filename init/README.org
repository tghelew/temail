#+TITLE: OpenBSD Installation
#+author: Thierry Ghelew

* Summary
This part is mostly manual as it has to do with the installation of OpenBSD itself and the mandatory configurations. I will not go through the installation process as it is well documented all over the internet and also in the main [[https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download][FAQ]] of the project.
The only part that I want to highlight is the filesystem petitioning scheme I'll be using along with the common configuration for ssh and doas.

** Disk Setup
Reference: [[https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel][Disklabel(8)]] [[https://man.openbsd.org/hier][hier(7)]]

This is the auto partitioning scheme provided during the installation

With a disk size of 40GB and 2GB of RAM.
| filesystem | size (GB) | percent |
|------------+-----------+---------|
| /          |         1 |     2.5 |
| swap       |         3 |     7.5 |
| /usr       |         3 |     7.5 |
| /home      |         3 |     7.5 |
| /tmp       |         1 |     2.5 |
| /var       |        10 |     25. |
| /var/log   |         2 |      5. |
| /usr/local |         5 |    12.5 |
| /var/misc  |        12 |     30. |
|------------+-----------+---------|
| Total      |        40 |    100. |

** Sets
Make sure to remove unneeded sets like games and xservers

** OpenSSH
I like to use a specific port ~[:2203]~ with [[https://www.openssh.com][OpenSSH]] which means changing configurations and relaunching the service.
I also don't want anyone to be able to connect using ssh with a password.
/Note: make sure to copy your ssh public key prior to change the above and restart the service/

#+begin_src sh
su -
sed -i \
    -e 's/#*Port.*/Port 2203/' \
    -e 's/#*PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' \
    -e 's/#*PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication no/' \
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Make sure to copy your ssh public key prior to execute command below
# on the local machine where your public key is available:
# ssh-copy-id -p 22 -fi /path/to/your/id user@remote

rcctl restart sshd
#+end_src

** DOAS
[[https://man.openbsd.org/doas][DOAS]] is a minimalist sudo that works very well in OpenBSD. The following are the configuration I like to set:

#+begin_src sh
cp -f /etc/examples/doas.conf /etc/doas.conf
cat >> /etc/doas.conf <<-EOF
    permit nopass keepenv setenv { ENV=/home/thierry/.profile } thierry
    permit nopass keepenv setenv { PATH } root as root
EOF
#+end_src
